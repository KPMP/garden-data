# tiff-to-ome-tiff conversion for IMC images

## How does this work
This uses a _summary.txt file provided to us from IMC to convert their tiff image to a .ome.tif image that vitessce can understand

## Usage
Currently this takes in two files.
1. txt file with the channel names and the like
2. tif file from IMC
 There is a directory variable that should be modified to point at the direcotry where the .txt and .tif files are located
